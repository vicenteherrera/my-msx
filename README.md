# My MSX Basic programs

MSX Basic programs I created when I was a child, and other MSX related stuff.

I owned an MSX Spectravideo SVI-728 with a Computone cassette player, later to add a 5,25' disk drive.

Files without extension are MSX-basic saved in binary format (the default to save space). Same name with `.bas` extension are saved with `,A` parameter in ASCII.

"Átomo" (atom in Spanish) is the main program I wanted to preserve in this repository. There are two versions with small differences.

I programmed it to simulate what I was reading in my school science book about the experiments conducted to demonstrate that the atom was constituted of a heavy and dense positive-charged nucleus (protons and neutrons), and a sparse crust with a negative charge (electrons).

To program this I had some Basic books that told me about generic programming. But the more complex stuff I learned when looking into other people’s code in magazines.

I distinctly remember discovering negative numbers by subtracting 10 from a variable that had a value of 5, time before being taught that in school. And of course, all English words I learned first using Basic. Another interesting topic is that to create the circular trajectories of electrons, I had to use the `sin` and `cos` functions, but that I had no idea what meant. I got it to work after looking into several examples and by trial and error; it was years later when I was taught trigonometry.

### Misc directory

Miscelaneous programs, I will document more here about them later.

### Sprites directory

On the `sprites` directory are several programs that hold sprites I was drawing, characters remapping and other animations I was doing in order to be able to use them in games.

I never got too far with this, which is a shame. I was discouraged by other Basic programs I was coding from magazines and books, or from them in cassettes, that I didn't find very interesting. Just doing something similar but with my sprites was not enough for me.

### Sounds directory

Here are several programs using sound, I think I just copied code I found interesting on other programs for later use in my own creations.

One of them is the playing song of "Penelope", which I think I learned first to play in a digital piano we had, and later I programmed in Basic coding every note. Anyways that program is corrupted and I only could get some of the code.

### Others directory

Here I include Basic programs by other people that were also on my disks, including a Sprite drawing program that I was using to create my own.

## Rescuing the programs

These programs lived in several 5,25' disks that could only be read from my MSX machine. I had a PC 5,25' drive that I had no way to use, as it could only be used with old motherboards. When I finally got to buy a special MSX Cartdridge that could save to an SD card, and tried it... my MSX was dead after being functional for more than 30 years. I was trying to fix it by myself when one day I found a deal for an second hand equivalent Spectravideo MSX model (the disk drive doesn't work on other MSX machines).

You can read some of my tweets about it in these threads
